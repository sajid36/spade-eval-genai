Repo to share the regular and engineered prompts using different GenAI. 

Here's a table summarizing the behaviors and capabilities of Ransomware, InfoStealers, and Keyloggers:

| **Malware Type**        | **Behaviors and Capabilities**                                                                                |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ransomware**          | - Encrypts files on the victim's system, rendering them inaccessible.                                         |
|                         | - Displays a ransom note demanding payment (usually in cryptocurrency) for decryption.                        |
|                         | - Some variants exfiltrate data (info about the victim and keys) before encryption.                           |
| **InfoStealer**         | - Focuses on extracting sensitive information such as credentials, banking data, and personal information.    |
|                         | - Steals browser-stored passwords, cookies, and autofill data.                                                |
|                         | - Collects data from email clients, FTP clients, cryptocurrency wallets, or gaming accounts.                  |
|                         | - Can exfiltrate stolen data to a command-and-control (C2) server.                                            |
| **Keylogger**           | - Records keystrokes made by the victim, capturing sensitive information like passwords and PINs.             |
|                         | - Logs application usage, clipboard content, and screenshots.                                                 |
